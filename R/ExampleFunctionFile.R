## This is just a placeholder file, so that the R directory will show up on GitHub.

# Robin: please place your function files in this "R" directory, in whatever
# shape they are, and I will start looking at them. I can set up some of the
# documentation, and then when we're ready to meet, I can show you how to build
# up that same documentation using the roxygen2 package.
