# luckieR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of luckieR is to provide user-friendly and generalized tools
for the calculation of “luck” – moments of variation in metrics like
lifespan and lifetime reproductive output. We provide tools for
calculating those moments and also performing decompositions into
contributions from, for example, individual traits, environmental
impacts, and luck (also called individual stochasticity).

## Installation

Currently, the package has not been built. At this point, this is our
space for development of the package. When it is ready to be downloaded
from GitHub and/or CRAN, we will update this section with installation
instructions.

<!-- You can install the development version of luckieR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- # install.packages("pak") -->

<!-- pak::pak("chrissy3815/luckieR") -->

<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(luckieR) # Again, this does not yet exist!
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
