NOTES ON WHAT ROBIN NEEDS TO LOOK AT IN LUCKIER PACKAGE
Chrissy last updated 01-19-2026

1. probTraitCondLRONoEnv - Should the input variables be called Plist and Flist, or PlistAllTraits and FlistAllTraits? I am unsure whether to rename things, but the function and documentation have errors due to this.

2. probTraitCondLROPostBreedingNoEnv - same as item 1, issues with variable names Plist and Flist vs. PlistAllTraits and FlistAllTraits.

3. distLifespanCondR2NoEnv - has a "sanity check" block at the beginning of the function that requires a variable "numEnv" which is not an input variable to this function. 

4. distLifespanCondR2PostBreedingNoEnv - same as item 3 - R is trying to find "numEnv" as a global variable.

5. getModalTimeToHitState - no documentation written. Also has an issue where the input variable is called Plist but line 563 tries to access a variable called "P" that does not exist. Should it be P[[1]][1]?
