NOTES ON WHAT ROBIN NEEDS TO LOOK AT IN LUCKIER PACKAGE
Chrissy last updated 01-19-2026

1. probTraitCondLRONoEnv - Should the input variables be called Plist and Flist, or PlistAllTraits and FlistAllTraits? I am unsure whether to rename things, but the function and documentation have errors due to this.

It should be PlistAllTraits, etc.  These are lists of lists of matrices, unlike Plist and Flist, which are lists of matrices.

2. probTraitCondLROPostBreedingNoEnv - same as item 1, issues with variable names Plist and Flist vs. PlistAllTraits and FlistAllTraits.

Still PlistAllTraits, etc.

3. distLifespanCondR2NoEnv - has a "sanity check" block at the beginning of the function that requires a variable "numEnv" which is not an input variable to this function.

I got rid of the sanity check, since distLifespanCondR2 will do that sanity check first thing.

4. distLifespanCondR2PostBreedingNoEnv - same as item 3 - R is trying to find "numEnv" as a global variable.

Sanity check removed.

5. getModalTimeToHitState - no documentation written. Also has an issue where the input variable is called Plist but line 563 tries to access a variable called "P" that does not exist. Should it be P[[1]][1]?

Oy.  Let me write some documentation.  And I've added a new function, makeMCondLROThreshold, to partitiningUtilities.R, but it's not debugged yet and I have no tests for it yet.  Just an fyi.

And P should be P[[1]] on line 563.  Fixed.
