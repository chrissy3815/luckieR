# luckieR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of luckieR is to provide user-friendly and generalized tools for the calculation of "luck" -- moments of variation in metrics like lifespan and lifetime reproductive output. We provide tools for calculating those moments and also performing decompositions into contributions from, for example, individual traits, environmental impacts, and luck (also called individual stochasticity).

## Installation

Currently, the package has not been built. At this point, this is our space for development of the package. When it is ready to be downloaded from GitHub and/or CRAN, we will update this section with installation instructions.

<!-- You can install the development version of luckieR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("pak") -->
<!-- pak::pak("chrissy3815/luckieR") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(luckieR) # Again, this does not yet exist!
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
