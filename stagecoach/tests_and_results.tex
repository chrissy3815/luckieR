\title{Testing the \texttt{stageCoach} functions}

\caption{Life cycle used for testing the \texttt{stageCoach} functions. When one arrow exits
a compartment, the transition probability is 1. When multiple arrows exit a compartment, they are 
equally likely and their total probability is 1. Thus, all individuals eventually reach state 7 and then die. 
Only compartment state 6 has positive fecundity, with a 50\% chance of breeding.}
